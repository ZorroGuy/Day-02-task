1, Difference between Document and Window Objects in JavaScript

Document Object (DOM)

1. Represents the structure and content of the webpage.
  
2. Facilitates DOM manipulation through methods like `getElementById()` and `querySelector()`.

3. Allows access to and modification of HTML elements, their attributes, and text content.

4. Enables event handling for user interactions like clicks, mouse movements, and keypresses.

5. Focuses on the content within the webpage, providing methods for dynamic updates without page reloads.

Window Object:

1. Represents the browser window or tab hosting the document.

2. Serves as the global scope in a browser environment.

3. Provides browser interaction functionalities like navigation, resizing, and opening new windows.

4. Contains timing functions (`setTimeout()` and `setInterval()`) for executing code after delays or at regular intervals.

5. Controls browser features and properties such as dimensions, location, and history.
